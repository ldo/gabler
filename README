This project provides (partial) Python wrappers for the
[GEGL](https://gegl.org/) and [BABL](https://gegl.org/babl/) graphics
libraries. The aim is to provide enough functionality to be useful in
plugins written for [GIMP](https://gimp.org/) in Python.

In order to actually write such plugins, you will need my `pylibgimp`
wrapper for the GIMP API
([`GitLab`](https://gitlab.com/ldo/pylibgimp2),
[`GitHub`](https://github.com/ldo/pylibgimp2)).
